## Our Projects

Our open-source projects include:

- the [Pkl Playground](https://pkl-playground.vercel.app/)
- a [`setup-pkl` GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-pkl)
- [NPM packages for Pkl](https://github.com/pkl-community/node-packages), which allow you to run Pkl with `npx @pkl-community/pkl`, or embed the Pkl runtime in a Node.js application
- language bindings (WIP) for [TypeScript](https://github.com/pkl-community/pkl-typescript), [Python](https://github.com/pkl-community/pkl-python) (and others in the future - maybe yours?)
